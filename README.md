C# Workshop Demo Files
==============

This is a collection of demo files for C# Workshop, my project for teaching C# from start to finish. 

Most of these will be command line code, as most of the lessons use the command line, at least in the beginning. 

The website should be done by Spring 2014.

Some of this will be based on tutorials posted on my [programming blog](http://www.jeremymorgan.com). I will keep updating this as I go.
